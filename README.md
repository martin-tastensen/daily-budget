# daily budget
Others have requested access to my budget tool, so here it is. It is provided as-is

# Idea
The generel idea, is to take a a bank statement and use powershell to add each widrawal into a set category with the purpose of mapping expected income and expenses with the real usage. As soon as the data is categories, you can use your preferred software to create a visible overview of your expenses and income but i will provide an example using MS Excel

# Configuration
There will be some configuration required, and you can risk that you have to do some changes dependent on language and headers from your provider, however, these changes should be minor, and will be covered in the Wiki - if something isen't covered please create an issue.

Do note: this was never expected to be a project, i build it to get a better overview of our own expensesm but if it can help others, then i see no harm in sharing
